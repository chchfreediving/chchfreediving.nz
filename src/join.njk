      <p>We love new members! Whether you're brand new to the sport and want to try it out, or super-experienced and want to train for your next world record, you want you to feel welcome at Christchurch Freediving Club.</p>
      <p>Everyone has to attend an induction, even if you've been diving for years, you've taken a course, or you're a member of another club, see our <a href="start.html">starting page</a>. You must be 18 or older to do an induction or join the club.</p>
      <p>Once you've done an induction, you can join the club. You'll need to fill out the membership form below and pay the club fees. Our fees are $120 per calendar year ($90 for students). Then you can attend our <a href="train.html">training sessions</a>, trips, and other events. Alternatively, you can pay $10 per session for casual training (but you still need to do an induction).</p>
      <p>Joining the club will make you a member of Freediving New Zealand which means you can enter AIDA competitions.</p>
      <p>To join, you'll need to fill out the form below. You should have filled out an <a href="https://forms.gle/ewdrsepquTRHwiA6A">induction form</a>, a <a href="resources/cfc-participation-agreement-v2.pdf">participation agreement</a>, and a <a href="https://forms.gle/1uR19ZHtw15W7q4h8">medical questionnaire</a> before your induction. If details on any of these forms have changed, please fill out a new one.</p>
